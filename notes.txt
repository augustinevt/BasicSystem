Okay, that was intense!

  I made little headway for making the class take in a rule set it's definitely clunky, but it will work

  Also have the agent display function from the system class... not at all a good thing but good to prove the it can be done

to be honest I'm not sure where to take it, although the flux style state is is great, I think I can definitely extend this for art and game purposes!

could influence "8bitart" but not sure...

anyway, good fight! Now go and rest!
