Okay, that was intense!

===

  I made little headway for making the class take in a rule set it's definitely clunky, but it will work

  Also have the agent display function from the system class... not at all a good thing but good to prove the it can be done

===

to be honest I'm not sure where to take it, although the flux style state is is great, I think I can definitely extend this for art and game purposes!

could influence "8bitart" but not sure...

anyway, good fight! Now go and rest!

====== conway rules ====

// (agent, grid) => {
//   const neighborhood = getNeighborhood(grid, agent.x, agent.y, 1)
//   let blueCount = 0;
//
//   neighborhood.forEach(char => {
//     char === 0 ? blueCount++ : null;
//   })
//
//   if (agent.type === 1 && blueCount === 3) {
//     return new Agent(0, agent.x, agent.y)
//   } else if (agent.type === 0 && (blueCount < 2 || blueCount > 3)) {
//     return new Agent(1, agent.x, agent.y)
//   } else {
//     return new Agent(agent.type, agent.x, agent.y)
//   }
//
// }
